# Dynamic form with conditional rendering
## Requirements:
- Login Page with User Authentication
- Dynamic Form rendering and displaying data based off of user Input
- A display of all questions answered after the user submits the form
- Pagination
- Form Validation

## Notes
- Written with Vue 3 Options API with a Mock B.E (mock authentication)
- There are a lot of things I would love to rework if I had more time, and would love to chat more about it!
- Deployment to Github pages as my cloud provider using Jekyll


# Set-up Instructions
- please fork on clone the repository to your local machine
SSH, or HTTP is fine.
- once you have done that, assuming you're in the terminal, `cd` into the project directory and run the following
```sh
npm install
```

to create a local build, run

```sh
npm run dev
```
